Remote XUL has many security restrictions so for applications like XULLauncher you need special local chrome files with an overlay. Download it here:

To run it use
{{{
xulrunner application.ini
}}}
or with Firefox 3 beta
{{{
firefox -app application.ini
}}}

If you want to run it with the JavaScript console, add the parameter -jsconsole
{{{
xulrunner application.ini -jsconsole
}}}

You need to use the full path to application.ini on MacOS. XULRunner >= 1.8 should be ok.
